        "description": "Analyzed the impact of socioeconomic status on 'Improve Detroit' requests across neighborhoods. Key findings include the strong correlation between new vacant properties and request volume, and the negative correlation of higher median earnings and home values with requests. Developed a predictive model with an Adjusted R^2 of 0.613 using median earnings and new vacant properties.\n\nData Visualization, Natural Language Processing, Regression Analysis, Supervisied Machine Learning, Data Modeling, Data Warehousing, Data Transformation, Data Cleaning",

Key findings include the VAR model achieving an RÂ² of 0.973 and RSE of 2.08 with significant predictors: previous CSI values, employment, mortgage rates, and total vehicle sales. Addressed ethical considerations such as sampling bias and prediction consequences.\n\nTime Series Analysis, Supervised Machine Learning, Regularization, Data Visualization",
